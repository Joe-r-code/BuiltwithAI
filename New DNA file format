This note book collates my ideas on a new nucleic acid format.

I think this would be useful for several reasons.

There is more information than the five canonical (ATCGU) bases which are found in most nucleic acid based chemicals. 

Modification of nucleotides is a common occurance in DNA and RNA and more and more methodologies are becoming available to study these.

But no data file exists that compiles both sequence data and base modification into one easily computer and human parsable file.


I wish to create a comprehensive, interactive nucleic acid polymer database which could include this new file format.


In brief the file structure would be in the format:



\#information on the sequence 

\@'Number of strands in the contiguous sequence'

\>F forward strand (5' - 3')
\<R reverse strand (5' - 3')

Such that the file format would be:

\# sequence 1
\@ 2
\F> gt(6maA)c
\R< gt(6mA)c


So the format is similar to already available formats. But includes all the strands of the nucleic acid polymer 

There is a header for each sequence represented by @ that says how many complimentary strands the contiguous sequence has.

Then there is the sequence of the complimentary strands.

This a basic example of a sequence record in this file format.

I hope the format will be able to:

Be able to include all known base modifications.

This could be included by linking to a chemical database API.

Include gaps on a single strand. But still be parsable to produce a contiguous sequence. This could represent extra-helical bases.


Included in this notebook are possible ideas on scripts to convert sequence data that had modification data.

A starting point could be to convert the Streptococcus pneumonia genome sequences into a new file format where each epigenetic state is included for each assembly.

An example of:

\# D39 (sequence accession)

% SpnI: #ds #pallindromic #target site: g(6mA)tc

% SpnII: #ss #target site: g(6mA)tc'

% SpnIII: # bi-partite #phase-variable #state: A
\#target site:
F>CRA(6mA)N8CTG 
R< C(6mA)GN8TTYG

%SpnIV: #pseudo

%SpnV: #type IV #target site: 

F>
R<
